Finance management App:
I wanted to learn the differences between typescript and javascript and see which one I would like best when developing in React. I also wanted to learn about implementing Firebase as a DBMS, and how to have users use their google account for authentication.
In this project I followed a tutorial provided on YouTube by Travolgi.
Here is a screenshot of the main page:

To run this make sure to clone the repository. Then type in the terminal:
npm install
To install the necessary packages, also be sure to have the latest version of Node, git and npm.
Then run 
npm start 
To see the project on your browser.
